## Threat Intelligence (CTI) Gathering and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding how Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is gathered, analyzed, and applied in real-world security operations. Instead of technical exploitation, the project emphasizes analytical thinking, attacker behavior, and proactive defense strategies used by SOC and Threat Intelligence teams.

As a intern, this project helped me move from reactive security thinking to a proactive, intelligence-driven security mindset.

## Objectives
- Understand Cyber Threat Intelligence concepts and lifecycle
- Learn how threat data is collected from multiple sources
- Analyze threats using context and relevance
- Map threat intelligence to SOC operations and MITRE ATT&CK
- Develop structured reporting and documentation skills

## Scope of the Project
- Open-Source Threat Intelligence (OSINT)
- Threat Intelligence Lifecycle
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Threat Actor Profiling
- SOC integration and alert prioritization

## Tools & Resources (Conceptual)
- OSINT platforms (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX)
- Security blogs and threat reports
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- SIEM & SOC workflows (theoretical mapping)

## Learning Outcomes
- Strong understanding of CTI fundamentals
- Ability to differentiate noise from real threats
- Improved analytical and defensive thinking
- Practical understanding of SOC decision-making

## Disclaimer
This project is purely educational and does not involve unauthorized access, exploitation, or illegal activities.
